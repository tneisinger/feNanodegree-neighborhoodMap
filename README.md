Neighborhood Map - Udacity Front End Nanodegree Project #5
==========================================================

## Synopsis

This is my submission for project #5 in the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree
program.  It is a single page web application that utilizes the Google Maps API
and the Yelp Business API to provide information about a collection of
restaurants in my neighborhood.

The source code for this project can be found in src/ while the optimized code
is saved in the dist/ directory.

## Setup

The final project can be seen
[here](http://tneisinger.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio).  If
you would like to install and run this project on your local machine, clone
this repo do XXXXXX, and open the dist/index.html file in your favorite web
browser.

All source code for this project is located in the src/ directory.  This
project uses npm and grunt to minify images and source code and place them into
the dist/ directory.  If you wish to modify the source code, it is recommended
that you use grunt to re-minify the source code and save it into the dist/
directory.
