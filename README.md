Neighborhood Map - Frontend Project #5
==========================================================

## Synopsis

This is my submission for project #5 in the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree
program.  It is a single page web application that utilizes the Google Maps API
and the Yelp Business API to provide information about a collection of
restaurants in my neighborhood.

The source code for this project can be found in src/ while the optimized code
is saved in the dist/ directory.

## Setup

The final project can be seen
[here](http://tneisinger.github.io/feNanodegree-neighborhoodMap).  If you would
like to install and run this project on your local machine, clone this repo and
run `npm install` in the repo's root directory. After npm has installed all the
dependencies, open the dist/index.html file in your favorite web browser.

All source code for this project is located in the src/ directory.  This
project uses grunt to minify source code and place it into the dist/ directory.
If you wish to modify the source code, it is recommended that you use grunt to
re-minify the source code and save it into the dist/ directory.
